**Original Task:** S17-08

## Description

Add dedicated quarterly (every 3 months) and bi-annual (every 6 months) interval options. Currently users must set custom-day intervals manually. These are the most common long-cycle patterns for the Homeowner persona (HVAC filters, smoke detectors, car inspections).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New interval options in creation: Quarterly, Bi-Annual (alongside Weekly, Monthly, Annual)
- [ ] Quarterly: fires every 3 months on the same day
- [ ] Bi-Annual: fires every 6 months on the same day
- [ ] Month-end overflow handling (same as monthly)
- [ ] Badge colors for new intervals
- [ ] Templates (TIER-04) reference these intervals
