## Version 1.0 — Metadata

### Promotional Text

```
Never miss what matters. Chronir turns long-cycle tasks into real alarms that demand action.
```

### Description

```
Chronir is the alarm app for everything your regular reminders forget.

Rent due on the 1st. Car insurance renewal. Annual furnace inspection. Pet vaccinations. These aren't tasks you can afford to miss — but a silent notification buried under 50 others isn't enough. Chronir treats your long-cycle obligations with the urgency of a morning wake-up alarm: full-screen, persistent, undeniable.

HOW IT WORKS
Set an alarm for any recurring schedule — weekly, monthly, annually, or one-time. When the time comes, Chronir fires a real alarm with sound and a full-screen alert. No quiet notification. No easy dismiss. You acknowledge it, snooze it, or mark it done.

KEY FEATURES

— Real Alarms, Not Reminders
Full-screen firing with persistent sound. Fires even in Do Not Disturb and on your lock screen. This is an alarm, not a notification.

— Flexible Scheduling
Weekly (every Sunday), monthly (1st and 15th), annual (Feb 28), or one-time (car registration due March 1). You set it once, Chronir handles the rest.

— Siri & Shortcuts
"Create an alarm in Chronir" — set alarms by voice or automate them with Shortcuts. Ask "When is my next alarm?" or "Show my alarms" hands-free.

— Categories & Grouping
Organize alarms by category — Home, Health, Finance, Vehicle, Work, Personal, Pets, Subscriptions. Group view keeps your list clean.

— Smart Snooze
Snooze for 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week. Persistent alarms keep firing until you take action.

— Wallpaper Personalization
Set a custom background photo with pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-reposition. Your alarm list, your style.

CHRONIR PLUS ($1.99/month)
Unlock unlimited alarms, custom snooze intervals, pre-alarm warnings, photo attachments, and completion history with streaks.

Built for homeowners, caregivers, pet owners, freelancers, and anyone who needs long-cycle accountability — not another to-do list.

## App Review Information

### Sign-In Information

```
Sign-in required: No
(Free tier does not require an account)
```

### Review Notes

```
Chronir is a recurring alarm app. The Free tier allows 2 alarms with no account required. To test the full experience:

1. Create an alarm: Tap the + button, set a title, choose a schedule (e.g., Weekly > Sunday at 1:00 PM), and save.
2. Wait for the alarm to fire, or set it for 1 minute from now to test firing.
3. On the firing screen, you can Snooze (1h/1d/1w) or mark Done.
4. The 2-alarm limit triggers a paywall prompt when creating a 3rd alarm.

The app uses AlarmKit (iOS 26+) to fire alarms on the lock screen with full sound. Notification permission is requested on first alarm creation.

No special hardware or external accounts are needed for review.
