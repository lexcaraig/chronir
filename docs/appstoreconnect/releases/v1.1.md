Live Activity Countdown
Chronir now shows a countdown on your lock screen and Dynamic Island when an alarm is within one hour. You'll always know exactly how much time you have left before your next obligation fires.

Also in this update:
- Fixed cloud sync: alarms now reliably sync to iCloud for Plus subscribers
- Improved color-blind accessibility with icon indicators on alarm badges
- Faster cold start with optimized widget refresh and reduced splash duration
- Fixed an issue where the Live Activity banner could linger after stopping an alarm
- Fixed a brief overdue state flash when dismissing alarms from the Dynamic Island
- New "Live Activity Countdown" toggle in Settings > Notifications
```
