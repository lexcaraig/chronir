# Privacy Policy

CycleAlarm ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you use our mobile application ("App") available on iOS and Android platforms.

By downloading, installing, or using CycleAlarm, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

The information we collect depends on which subscription tier you use.

### 1.1 Free Tier (No Account Required)

When using CycleAlarm at the Free tier, all data is stored locally on your device. We collect:

- **Alarm Data (Local Only):** Alarm titles, recurrence intervals, scheduled times, and snooze preferences. This data never leaves your device.
- **Device Information:** Anonymous, non-identifiable technical data including device model, operating system version, and app version for crash reporting and compatibility purposes.
- **Crash and Performance Data:** Anonymous crash logs and performance metrics collected through Firebase Crashlytics to improve app stability.

We do **not** collect your name, email address, phone number, or any personally identifiable information at the Free tier.

### 1.2 Plus Tier (Account Required)

When you upgrade to Plus, the following additional data is collected:

- **Account Information:** Email address, display name, and authentication credentials managed through Firebase Authentication. If you sign in via Google or Apple, we receive your name and email as provided by those services.
- **Alarm Data (Cloud-Synced):** Your alarm configurations, pre-alarm warning preferences, completion history, and associated notes are synced to our cloud infrastructure to enable cross-device access and backup.
- **Photo Attachments:** Images you attach to alarms (e.g., product photos, reference images) are uploaded to cloud storage.
- **Usage Data:** Feature usage patterns, alarm creation frequency, and completion rates to improve the App experience.

### 1.3 Premium Tier (Account Required)

In addition to all data collected at the Plus tier:

- **Shared Alarm Data:** When you share alarms with other users, we process the alarm data, recipient identifiers, and group membership to facilitate real-time collaboration.
- **Contact Information for Sharing:** Email addresses or invite links used to connect with other CycleAlarm users for shared alarms and groups.
- **Group Data:** Group names, member lists, and assigned alarm responsibilities.

### 1.4 Information We Never Collect

- Location data
- Contacts or address book (beyond explicit sharing invitations you initiate)
- Microphone or camera access (photo attachments use the system photo picker only)
- Advertising identifiers
- Browsing history
- SMS, call logs, or any communication content

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information solely for the following purposes:

- **Providing Core Functionality:** Scheduling, triggering, and managing your recurring alarms.
- **Cloud Sync and Backup:** Ensuring your alarms persist across device upgrades and are accessible on multiple devices (Plus and Premium tiers).
- **Shared Alarms:** Delivering alarm notifications to shared group members and displaying completion status (Premium tier).
- **App Improvement:** Analyzing anonymous crash reports and performance data to fix bugs and improve reliability.
- **Customer Support:** Responding to your inquiries and resolving technical issues.
- **Communication:** Sending transactional emails related to your account, subscription, or critical app updates. We do not send marketing emails unless you explicitly opt in.

We do **not** use your data for advertising, profiling, or sale to third parties.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### 3.1 Local Storage

- **iOS:** Alarm data is stored using SwiftData on your device. Free tier data is included in your device's iCloud backup if you have iCloud enabled in your device settings.
- **Android:** Alarm data is stored using Room database on your device. Free tier data is included in your device's Google backup if enabled.

### 3.2 Cloud Storage (Plus and Premium)

Cloud-synced data is stored using Google Firebase services, hosted on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. Firebase provides:

- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance
- ISO 27001 certification

### 3.3 Security Measures

We implement industry-standard security practices including:

- Secure authentication via Firebase Auth with support for email/password, Google Sign-In, and Apple Sign-In
- Firestore Security Rules restricting data access to authenticated, authorized users only
- Minimal data collection principle — we only collect what is necessary for the App to function
- Regular security reviews of our backend configuration

While we take reasonable measures to protect your data, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

---

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless [Your Legal Entity Name], its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of a third party.
